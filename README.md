# Floral_Sales_Project
 Predicting Future Floral sales data

# Description

The goal of this project is to help the owner of the floral shop to understand the trends and patterns in sales, and use a predictive macjing learning model to make predictions for the future sales of the shop. This uses real data from a friend of mine's shop, for the sake of privacy I will not use the actual name of the shop, but the data is from a fine floral shop in middle Tennennsee. 

# Data 

The data was provided to me be the shop owner, who uses floranext as their sales operating system. I was provided sales reports downloaded from this site in csv format as the data i will be using.
